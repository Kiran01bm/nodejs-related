## yarn/yarn-ver2

### Plug'n'Play

RIP node_modules - In this install mode (now the default starting from Yarn v2), Yarn generates a single .pnp.js file instead of the usual node_modules. Instead of containing the source code of the installed packages, the .pnp.js file contains a map linking a package name and version to a location on the disk, and another map linking a package name and version to its set of dependencies. Thanks to this efficient system, Yarn can tell Node exactly where to look for files being required - regardless of who asks for them!
